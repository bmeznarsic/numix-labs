Numix Technic
========================

**This theme is still underdevelopment. Usage is not recommended.**

Technic (short for 'technicolour') as an icon theme by the Numix Project designed as a spiritual successor to the popular but no longer updated theme [AnyColorYouLike](http://pobtott.deviantart.com/art/Any-Color-You-Like-175624910). This icon theme has 3 very cool uses.

  1. As a standalong icon theme, Technic is awesome! Because none of the symbols are coloured especially light or dark it should work using most dark or light themes.

  2. As a single coloured icon theme. Using the script ```colour.sh``` provided you can change all the icon to be the same colour.

  3. As symbols for our Shine and uTouch icon themes. The symbols here will be taken and made straight into icon there too. This means that all the themes that do this are equally up to date with the latest additions.
